    function. The logged memory is collected by using the memory_profiler
    python module and includes memory used by children processes. The usage
    is collected by taking memory snapshots every 100ms. This decorator will
    only work with functions taking at least 0.5s to execute due to a bug in
    the memory_profiler python module. For more information about the bug,
    please see https://github.com/pythonprofilers/memory_profiler/issues/216
