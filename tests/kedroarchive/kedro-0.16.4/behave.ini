# These commands force behave to display all output regardless of the outcome of the test
stderr_capture=False
stdout_capture=False

# Single line print statements will not be shown even if output capture is off,
# to avoid that behaviour either add a new line at the end of the string ('\n') or disable color with:
# color=False
