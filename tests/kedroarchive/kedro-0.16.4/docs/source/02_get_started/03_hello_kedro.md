# A "Hello World" example

It is time to introduce the most basic elements of Kedro. We have split a small example into pieces to discuss each of the concepts with code.

You can copy the example as one chunk of code from the bottom of this page, or find it on the [`kedro-examples` Github repository](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-examples).

> Note: We do not create a Kedro project in this first example, but illustrate the concepts within a single `.py` file.

## Node

A `node` is a Kedro concept. It is a wrapper for a Python function that names the inputs and outputs of that function. It is the building block of a pipeline. Nodes can be linked when the output of one node is the input of another.

Here, the `return_greeting` function is wrapped by a node called `return_greeting_node`, which has no inputs, and names a single output(`my_salutation`):

```python
from kedro.pipeline import node

def return_greeting():
    # Prepare first node
    return "Hello"


return_greeting_node = node(
    func=return_greeting, inputs=None, outputs="my_salutation"
)
```

The `join_statements` function is wrapped by a node called `join_statements_node`, which names a single input (`my_salutation`) and a single output (`my_message`):

```python
def join_statements(greeting):
    # Prepare second node
    return f"{greeting} Kedro!"


join_statements_node = node(
    join_statements, inputs="my_salutation", outputs="my_message"
)
```

Note that `my_salutation` is the output of `return_greeting_node` and also the input of `join_statements_node`.

## Pipeline

A pipeline organises the dependencies and execution order of a collection of nodes, and connect inputs and outputs while keeping your code modular. The pipeline determines the node execution order by resolving dependencies and does *not* necessarily run the nodes in the order in which they are passed in.

In this example the pipeline executes `return_greeting_node` before it executes `join_statements_node`:

```python
from kedro.pipeline import Pipeline

# Assemble nodes into a pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([return_greeting_node, join_statements_node])
```

## DataCatalog

A `DataCatalog` is a Kedro concept. It is the registry of all data sources that the project can use. It maps the names of node inputs and outputs as keys in a `DataSet`, which is a Kedro class that can be specialised for different types of data storage. Kedro uses a `MemoryDataSet` for data that is simply stored in-memory.

```python
from kedro.io import DataCatalog, MemoryDataSet

# Prepare a data catalog
data_catalog = DataCatalog({"example_data": MemoryDataSet()})
```

Kedro provides a [number of different built-in datasets](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/kedro.extras.datasets.html#data-sets) for different file types and file systems so you donâ€™t have to write the logic for reading/writing data.

## Runner

The Runner is an object that runs the pipeline. Kedro resolves the order in which the nodes are executed:

1.  Kedro first executes `return_greeting_node`.
2.  The node runs `return_greeting`, which takes no input but outputs the string "Hello".
3.  The output string is stored in the `MemoryDataSet` named `example_data` with the key `my_salutation`.
4.  Kedro then executes the second node, `join_statements_node`.
5.  The node loads `my_salutation` from `example_data` and injects it into the `join_statements` function.
6.  The function joins the input salutation with "Kedro!" to form the output string "Hello Kedro!"
7.  The output string is stored within `example_data` as `my_message`.

## Hello Kedro!

It's now time to stitch the code together. Here is the full example:

```python
"""Content of hello_kedro.py"""
from kedro.io import DataCatalog, MemoryDataSet
from kedro.pipeline import node, Pipeline
from kedro.runner import SequentialRunner

# Prepare a data catalog
data_catalog = DataCatalog({"example_data": MemoryDataSet()})


def return_greeting():
    # Prepare first node
    return "Hello"


return_greeting_node = node(
    return_greeting, inputs=None, outputs="my_salutation"
)


def join_statements(greeting):
    # Prepare second node
    return f"{greeting} Kedro!"


join_statements_node = node(
    join_statements, inputs="my_salutation", outputs="my_message"
)

# Assemble nodes into a pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([return_greeting_node, join_statements_node])

# Create a runner to run the pipeline
runner = SequentialRunner()

# Run the pipeline
print(runner.run(pipeline, data_catalog))
```

Then open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python hello_kedro.py
```

You should see `{'my_message': 'Hello Kedro!'}` printed to the console.
